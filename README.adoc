= http-invoker-reloaded
Spring's deprecated HttpInvoker, brought back to life!

== Overview
http-invoker-reloaded is an unofficial, community-driven revival of Springâ€™s `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` functionality. It is built on top of Spring 5.3.x code, updated for modern Jakarta dependencies and Java versions, allowing you to continue using HttpInvoker in a post-Spring 6 environment.

== Features
- Modernized HttpInvoker for Jakarta EE
- Compatible with recent Java releases
- Similar configuration and usage patterns as the original Spring HttpInvoker
- A drop-in alternative for projects that still rely on HttpInvoker
